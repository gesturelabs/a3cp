(AAC). Traditional AAC helps millions of non-speaking people, but many individuals with complex motor, sensory, or
cognitive profiles cannot use these systems and are left without reliable ways to express themselves. We are building
an AI-driven communication system that learns from the user’s own gestures, sounds, and patterns
over time. Instead of forcing people to adapt to rigid interfaces, the system adapts to their abilities. It is designed
from the start to protect privacy, support ethical use, and operate transparently." %}
