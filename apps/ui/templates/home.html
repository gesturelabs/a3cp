    <h2>Who is behind A3CP?</h2>
    <p>
        A3CP is being developed by GestureLabs together with international partners from research and practice.
        The platform is built as public digital infrastructure: transparent, auditable, and independent of commercial
        lock-in.

    <h2>Current status</h2>
    <p>
        Core architecture and schemas are defined, and the first modular pipeline is under active development.
        We are preparing pilot collaborations with welfare and research partners for 2026.
