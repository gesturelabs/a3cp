(AAC). While existing AAC systems support many non-speaking individuals, they often remain inaccessible to people with
complex motor, sensory, or cognitive profiles. Our work develops an AI-based system that learns directly from each
user’s gestures and non-speech sounds. Instead of forcing users to adapt to a fixed interface, the interface adapts to
the individual. The system is built with strict privacy safeguards, transparent operation, and explicit ethical
constraints." %}
