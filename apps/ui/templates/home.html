    <h2>What A3CP does</h2>
    <p>
        A3CP learns how each person communicates through gestures, sounds, and context, and translates those signals
        into expressive output such as speech or text. Caregivers remain in control: they confirm or correct suggested
        meanings so the system can adapt safely and ethically over time.
    </p>
    <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Treats idiosyncratic gestures and sounds as valid input signals.</li>
        <li>Runs on open, affordable, and locally deployable infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Stores derived features instead of raw video/audio to protect privacy.</li>
        <li>Designed for welfare institutions, therapy centers, schools, and families.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Current status</h2>
    <p>
        Core architecture and schemas are defined, and the first modular pipeline is under active development.
        We are preparing pilot collaborations with welfare and research partners for 2026.
