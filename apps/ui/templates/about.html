{# PURPOSE #}
{% set ct_headline = "Why GestureLabs is building the Ability-Adaptive Communication Platform (A3CP)" %}
{% set ct_subheadline %}
A3CP is an open-source communication platform for people who cannot rely on speech. We work with families, clinicians,
and care organisations to build systems that learn how each person communicates—through movement, sound, and
context—rather than forcing them to adapt to rigid interfaces.
{% endset %}
{% include "components/_centered_text_block.html" %}


{# CHALLENGE / APPROACH / IMPACT #}
{% set tcr_title = "What problem is A3CP trying to solve?" %}
{% set tcr_intro %}
Many people with severe disabilities still lack reliable ways to communicate. Existing communication tools often assume
skills that not everyone has, leaving many people behind. A3CP is our attempt to give voice to these people.
{% endset %}
{% set tcr_cards = [
{
"title": "The Challenge",

communication tools are inflexible, people can become isolated and caregivers can feel overwhelmed, especially in
under-resourced care settings.",

{# STORY WITH PHOTO #}
{% set headline = "Erik and Andrea's Story" %}

{% set body_html %}
<p>
    A3CP began with a family’s experience. Andrea’s son Eric, a bright and curious child with cerebral palsy,
    understands two languages and communicates through sound, movement, and expression, but does not yet speak.
    Everyday interactions made two things clear: the richness of his non-verbal communication, and the limits of
    existing assistive systems that required him to adapt to fixed input methods he could not reliably control.
</p>

<p>
    Andrea’s wish to give her son a voice initiated a collaboration between technologists, designers, and
    researchers at The Open University (UK). Early prototypes combined a webcam, gesture recognition,
    and participatory design with families and therapists.
</p>

<p>
    GestureLabs was founded in Berlin to carry this work forward as a non-profit initiative. A3CP is now being
    developed as open, transparent infrastructure that care organisations, researchers, and families can freely
    use, improve, and share.

{# WHAT ARE WE BUILDING #}
{% set tcr_title = "What are We Building?" %}
{% set tcr_intro %}
A3CP is not a single app. It is a flexible system designed to work across schools, care settings, and family homes,
designed so that it can be customized for each user, because everyone is different.

{% set tcr_cards = [
{
"title": "A New Kind of Communication System",
"description": "A3CP uses everyday devices like cameras and microphones to understand movement and sound. It is designed
to work with affordable, widely available hardware in real-world settings."

Together they actively confirm intentions, correct misunderstandings, and shape how the system supports communication.",

"description": "Recognised intents can be rendered as speech, text, or symbols and integrated with existing AAC tools
where appropriate. The modular FastAPI-based stack and documented schemas are designed for extension and audit.",

choices about data, design, and governance.
