{% set ct_headline = "An open foundation for ability-adaptive, augmentative communication" %}
{% set ct_subheadline %}
GestureLabs is a non-profit organisation developing the Ability-Adaptive Augmentative Communication Platform (A3CP)
together with academic and care partners. A3CP is not a product or a device. It provides a shared foundation for
building
communication systems that can adapt to how different people express themselves through movement, sound, and everyday
interaction, rather than requiring people to adapt to fixed interfaces.

{# 2. THE PROBLEM — WHO IS CURRENTLY LEFT OUT #}
{% set psb_headline = "Who is still excluded from communication support" %}
{% set psb_body %}
<p>
    Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) includes many effective tools and practices. However, for a
    significant
    group of non-speaking people with profound motor and intellectual disabilities, existing systems remain difficult or
    impossible to use.
</p>
<p>
    Their communication often relies on highly personal combinations of movement, sound, facial expression, and context.
    These signals can be meaningful, but are typically understood only by close carers and are hard to support
    consistently
    across home, school, and care settings.
</p>
<p>
    While research has shown that such multimodal signals can be interpreted, there is currently no widely available,
    open system designed around this form of communication or its development over time.

{# CHALLENGE / APPROACH / IMPACT #}
{% set tcr_title = "What problem is A3CP trying to solve?" %}
{% set tcr_intro %}
Many people with severe disabilities still lack reliable ways to communicate. Existing communication tools often assume
skills that not everyone has, leaving many people behind. A3CP is our attempt to give voice to these people.

{# STORY WITH PHOTO #}
{% set headline = "Where This Began" %}

{% set body_html %}
<p>
    A3CP began with a family’s experience. Andrea’s son Eric, a bright and curious child with cerebral palsy,
    understands two languages and communicates through sound, movement, and expression, but does not yet speak.
    Everyday interactions made two things clear: the richness of his non-verbal communication, and the limits of
    existing assistive systems that required him to adapt to fixed input methods he could not reliably control.
</p>

<p>
    Andrea’s wish to give her son a voice initiated a collaboration between technologists, designers, and
    researchers at The Open University (UK). Early prototypes combined a webcam, gesture recognition,
    and participatory design with families and therapists.
</p>

<p>
    GestureLabs was founded in Berlin to carry this work forward as a non-profit initiative. A3CP is now being
    developed as open, transparent infrastructure that care organisations, researchers, and families can freely
    use, improve, and share.
