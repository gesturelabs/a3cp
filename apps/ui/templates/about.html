{# 1. PAGE OPENER — IDENTITY & SCOPE #}
{% set ct_eyebrow = "GestureLabs e.V. · In collaboration with The Open University (UK)" %}
{% set ct_headline = "An open foundation for ability-adaptive, augmentative communication" %}
{% set ct_subheadline %}
GestureLabs is a non-profit organisation developing the Ability-Adaptive Augmentative Communication Platform (A3CP)
together with academic, practical, and care partners. A3CP is not a product or a device. It provides a shared
architecture for
building communication systems that can adapt to how different people express themselves through movement, sound, and
everyday
interaction, and is based on the principle that systems should adapt to the user rather than requiring people to adapt
to the system.

{# 2. THE PROBLEM #}
{% set tcb_title = "Persistent gaps in practice" %}
{% set tcb_points = [
"Highly individual, multimodal expression",
"Signals that change over time and context",
"Dependence on informal interpretation"
] %}
{% set tcb_headline = "Who is still excluded from communication support" %}
{% set tcb_body %}
<p>
    Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) includes many effective tools and practices. For a significant
    group
    of non-speaking people with profound motor and intellectual disabilities, however, existing systems remain difficult
    or
    impossible to use.
</p>
<p>
    Their communication often relies on highly personal combinations of movement, sound, facial expression, and context.
    These signals can be meaningful, but are typically understood only by close carers and are hard to support
    consistently
    across home, school, and care settings.
</p>
<p>
    While research has shown that such multimodal signals can be interpreted, there is currently no widely available,
    open
    system designed around this form of communication or its development over time.

{# 4. WHERE THIS BEGAN #}

{% set headline = "Where this began" %}

{% set body_html %}
<p>
    The impetus behind this research project is a deeply personal one. My ten-year-old son, Eric, is bilingual in his
    verbal understanding, and has boundless happiness and enthusiasm, but he does not (yet) speak. His remarkable
    determination and ability to communicate through various non-verbal ways inspires and entertains those around him.
</p>

<p>
    Try to imagine how frustrating and daunting it would be to be unable to express yourself freely, to be unable to
    communicate when you need or want something, and to be severely limited in your ability to interact with others.
    Being a mother of three children, including Eric – who has cerebral palsy – has allowed me to better understand the
    needs, challenges, and opportunities of people with limited communication abilities.
</p>

<p>
    Through Eric’s eyes I realised how much we take for granted in life and imagined how technology could be used to
    enhance communication. There is no “one-size-fits-all” – individuals are unique in their ways of communicating,
    acting, and living. This uniqueness is even more prominent when there are physical and cognitive limitations.
</p>

<p>
    Driven by the unique and diverse needs of people with disabilities, we are developing a novel personalised
    communication system that adapts to the abilities of individuals, instead of requiring individuals to learn and
    adapt to the system. The system will monitor individuals’ unique sounds, motions, and gestures, and translate these
    into easily understood communication. Combining advances and approaches in the fields of software engineering,
    human computer interaction, design technologies, and AI, I am excited to be able to contribute to the empowerment
    of so many people to express their thoughts, desires, and needs.

{# 5. GOVERNANCE & ROLES #}

{% set tc_eyebrow = "Governance & roles" %}
{% set tc_title = "How responsibility is structured" %}
{% set tc_lead = "GestureLabs e.V. stewards the open platform; research and algorithm development are conducted with
independent academic partners." %}

{% set tc_body %}
<p>
    GestureLabs e.V. is responsible for maintaining the A3CP repository, developing the open-source codebase, and
    stewarding the platform as a non-profit initiative. The association oversees governance, licensing, documentation,
    and contribution processes to keep the infrastructure transparent, auditable, and accessible to care organisations,
    researchers, and developers.
</p>

<p>
    Early work on multimodal models and interaction design was carried out at The Open University (UK), where Andrea
    Zisman,
    a professor and initiator of the project, led research and machine learning development. The Open University has
    funded the project to date and continues to contribute research methodology, evaluation design, and algorithmic
    work.
</p>

<p>
    Research partners operate independently from platform stewardship. This separation preserves academic autonomy,
    allows results to be published openly, and makes it possible for additional institutions to collaborate without
    vendor lock-in or proprietary dependencies.
