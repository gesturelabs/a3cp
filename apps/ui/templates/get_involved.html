A3CP is an open, research-driven platform for people who cannot rely on speech.
We work with care organizations, developers, researchers, and supporters to design,
test, and sustain ethical communication systems that are transparent, inspectable,
and freely replicable.

<p>
    We work with welfare institutions, therapy centers, and special-education schools to design and evaluate A3CP in
    practical, ethically governed pilots. The aim is careful iteration: defining realistic scenarios, testing
    interaction
    routines, and evaluating whether the system supports communication without disrupting care.
</p>

<p>
    Partner organizations receive early access to prototypes, structured onboarding, and a direct role in shaping
    workflows
    and success criteria. Feedback is translated into concrete changes to interaction flows, schemas, and evaluation.
</p>

<p>
    We take an ethics-first approach with clear privacy boundaries and minimal data retention, avoiding unnecessary
    capture
    of raw personal data.

<p>
    A3CP is developed in the open under the GestureLabs GitHub organization. We welcome contributions across backend
    services, inference pipelines, evaluation tooling, and interface work, with an emphasis on clarity, traceability,
    and reproducibility.
</p>

<p>
    The system is built around explicit data contracts (schemas) and structured logs so that behavior can be inspected,
    tested, and improved over time. This makes A3CP suitable both as a practical assistive-technology project and as a
    research testbed for uncertainty-driven interaction and caregiver-in-the-loop correction.
