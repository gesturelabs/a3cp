A3CP is being developed as an open, collaborative platform dedicated to communication as a human right. We invite care
organizations, developers, researchers, and social-innovation partners to help shape an ethical, transparent, and freely

<p>
    We are building partnerships with welfare institutions, therapy centers, and special-education schools to co-design
    and test the first pilot version of A3CP. Partner organizations can try early prototypes, provide feedback from
    practice, and help refine adaptive interaction strategies that fit everyday care routines.
</p>
<p>
    By joining the pilot network, you contribute directly to shaping a tool that will later be freely available for
    non-profit use worldwide.
