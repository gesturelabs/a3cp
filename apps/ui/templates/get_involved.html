    <h1>Get Involved</h1>
    <p>
        A3CP is being developed as an open, collaborative platform dedicated to communication as a human right.
        We invite care organizations, developers, researchers, and social-innovation partners to help shape an
        ethical, transparent, and freely replicable communication system for people who cannot speak.
        Your participation ensures that A3CP remains grounded in real-world care practice and guided by community
        values, not commercial interests.

    <h2>For Care Organizations</h2>
    <p>
        We are building partnerships with welfare institutions, therapy centers, and special-education schools
        to co-design and test the first pilot version of A3CP. Partner organizations can try early prototypes,
        provide feedback from practice, and help refine adaptive interaction strategies that fit everyday care
        routines.
    </p>
    <p>
        By joining the pilot network, you contribute directly to shaping a tool that will later be freely
        available for non-profit use worldwide.
