# Module: sound_playback

## Purpose
The `sound_playback` module enables authorized users to listen to recorded audio samples captured during input sessions. It is designed to support manual review, labeling verification, clarification workflows, and training dataset integrity checks, while operating under strict consent and audit constraints.

## Why It Matters
Being able to review original user audio is essential for verifying model behavior, clarifying ambiguous input, and ensuring training labels are correct. This module supports human-in-the-loop validation for developers and caregivers, helping maintain high data quality and ethical accountability.

## Responsibilities
- Load and render pre-recorded audio files (`.wav`) linked to valid sessions
- Provide waveform visualization and standard playback controls (play, pause, seek)
- Display metadata including:
  - `user_id`, `session_id`, `timestamp`, `intent_label`, `label_status`
- Support review of audio samples flagged for clarification or training
- Ensure that only consented or demo recordings are accessible

## Not Responsible For
- Capturing or recording live audio
- Performing inference, feature extraction, or classification
- Storing audio beyond the consent-controlled interface
- Managing model training or labeling pipelines

## Inputs
- `.wav` file path for a valid, previously recorded and approved sample
- Session metadata:
  - `user_id`, `session_id`, `timestamp`, `modality`
- Optional review context:
  - `intent_label`, `label_status`, `annotation_context`

## Outputs
- Interactive waveform playback interface
- Playback controls for manual review
- Display of associated session metadata
- Optional flagging or annotation interface for correction workflows

## CARE Integration
This module is used during clarification, debugging, or training review. It is not part of the real-time CARE loop, but operates over previously captured and stored audio records. All accessible files must be explicitly consented, and all accesses must be traceable through logs.

## Functional Requirements
- F1. Load audio files using file path or session lookup
- F2. Render waveform visualization and interactive playback controls
- F3. Display key session metadata alongside playback
- F4. Allow review users to flag or annotate recordings for follow-up
- F5. Enforce consent-based access control for all audio playback

## Non-Functional Requirements
- NF1. Playback must begin within <200ms after file load
- NF2. Interface must function on both desktop and mobile devices
- NF3. Must support `.wav` files with common sampling rates (e.g., 16kHz, 44.1kHz)
- NF4. Must degrade gracefully when files are missing or partially corrupted
- NF5. Playback tooling must not interfere with live capture or inference modules
- NF6. Access to audio must be strictly limited to consented or demo data
