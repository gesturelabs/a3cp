# Module: schema_recorder

## Purpose
The `schema_recorder` module is responsible for validating, serializing, and persistently storing structured runtime records that conform to a registered schema (e.g., `A3CPMessage`, `RawActionRecord`). It provides a unified interface for recording any schema-compliant object in a durable, auditable, and version-tracked manner.

## Why It Matters
This module forms the backbone of A3CPâ€™s audit, reproducibility, and retraining infrastructure. By standardizing how structured data is validated and logged, it eliminates redundant logging logic, ensures schema compliance, and preserves system-wide traceability for all recorded events and interactions.

## Responsibilities
- Validate input records against the expected schema version
- Serialize validated records to structured append-only formats (`.jsonl`, `.parquet`, etc.)
- Preserve insertion order for audit and replayability
- Log key metadata: `record_id`, `timestamp`, `schema_type`, `user_id`, `session_id`
- Optionally log source module, `action_id`, or extended provenance tags
- Ensure atomic write behavior and hashable file integrity
- Maintain schema registry to map types to storage formats and destinations

## Not Responsible For
- Performing classification, inference, or decision-making
- Modifying or enriching schema fields beyond validation
- Rendering, displaying, or dispatching outputs
- Triggering model training or running pipeline loops

## Inputs
- Any object conforming to a registered `pydantic` schema
  - e.g., `A3CPMessage`, `RawActionRecord`, `AuditEvent`
- Required metadata (may be embedded or passed externally):
  - `record_id`, `timestamp`, `schema_version`
  - `user_id`, `session_id` (if available)
  - `schema_type` (optional override if not inferred)

## Outputs
- Serialized records stored in:
  - `.jsonl` files (e.g., `logs/users/u1234/a3cp_message.jsonl`)
  - `.parquet` files (e.g., `data/session_xyz/gesture_record_001.parquet`)
- Metadata entries in provenance or audit logs
- Optional summary/index files for efficient search

## CARE Integration
The `schema_recorder` is invoked throughout the CARE pipeline wherever structured messages are finalized for storage. It is used to record:
- Incoming classified `A3CPMessage` records
- Annotated landmark sequences (`RawActionRecord`)
- CARE events and interactions (`AuditEvent`, future extensions)

It ensures that all runtime data written to disk is schema-compliant, validated, and reproducible for audit, replay, and retraining.

## Functional Requirements
- F1. Must validate all records against declared schema version
- F2. Must write records to disk in append-only fashion
- F3. Must preserve insertion order and emit atomic writes
- F4. Must hash output (if enabled) for data integrity tracking
- F5. Must support multiple schema types via registry

## Non-Functional Requirements
- NF1. Write latency must remain <50ms under normal I/O load
- NF2. Must recover cleanly from interrupted writes or invalid input
- NF3. Must support configurable log rotation and storage limits
- NF4. Must tolerate schema evolution (versioned, non-breaking changes)
- NF5. Must tag logs with module name and runtime environment for traceability
