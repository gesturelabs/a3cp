## Entities and roles (concise)

### A3CP — Ability-Adaptive, Augmentative Communication Platform
- Shared, open **architecture**
- Defines schemas, learning/adaptation logic, feedback loops, logging, and governance
- Not a product or user-facing system
- Foundation for all system variants

### Named systems (e.g. *Eric*, *Lisa*, …)
- **Needs-based system variants** built on A3CP
- Each name represents a **design lineage** for a class of communication needs
  - *Eric*: limited/absent speech, variable motor control, multimodal non-verbal input
  - *Lisa* (example): full mobility, tablet-first interaction
- Multiple people may use the same variant
- Per-person customisation occurs within a chosen variant

### GestureLabs e.V.
- **Non-profit steward**
- Maintains A3CP core
- Defines and documents system variants

### The Open University (research wing)
- **Research and methodology partner**
- Contributes evaluation, validation, and scientific frameworks
- Supports participatory and clinical research
- Independent from deployment and stewardship

### Summary
- Architecture: **A3CP**
- Variants: **Eric / Lisa / …**
- Stewardship: **GestureLabs e.V.**
- Research: **The Open University**
