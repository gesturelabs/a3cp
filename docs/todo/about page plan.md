# GestureLabs — About Page (Single-Page Plan)

This document defines the **final single-page structure** for the GestureLabs About page, using existing UI components plus one new callout component. The goal is clarity, credibility, and controlled inclusion of origin, responsibility, and governance without shifting the page into a product or personality narrative.

---

## 1. Page opener — Identity & scope
**Component:** `_centered_text_block`

**Purpose:**
Establish immediately what GestureLabs is and what category A3CP belongs to.

**Content intent:**
- GestureLabs as non-profit steward
- A3CP as open, ability-adaptive communication **architecture**, not a product, device, or therapy

---

## 2. The problem
**Component:** `_centered_text_block`

**Purpose:**
Define the systems-level problem without repetition or moral framing.

**Content intent:**
- Why many AAC systems fail non-speaking people
- Rigid assumptions about motor control, repeatability, and consistency
- Framed as a design and systems constraint, not an ethical claim

---

## 3. What we are building (at a glance)
**Component:** `_three_card_row`

**Purpose:**
Provide fast categorical clarity before deeper explanation.

**Cards:**
1. **A3CP — Architecture**
   Open foundation: schemas, adaptive learning logic, feedback loops, logging, governance
2. **Named Variants (Eric / Lisa / …)**
   Needs-based design lineages shared across users (not diagnoses)
3. **Deployable Systems**
   Per-person configurations instantiated within a selected variant

---

## 4. Entities and roles
**Component:** `_two_column_section`

**Purpose:**
Make institutional responsibility boundaries explicit and auditable.

**Main column:**
Short narrative explaining separation of:
- Architecture
- Variants
- Stewardship
- Research

**Aside column:**
Concise role summary:
- A3CP — core architecture
- Eric / Lisa — design variants
- GestureLabs e.V. — stewardship and governance
- The Open University — research partner

---

## 5. People & responsibility
**Component:** `_two_column_section`

**Purpose:**
Make human responsibility visible without introducing personality-driven narratives.

**Main column:**
Explanation of how GestureLabs assigns responsibility by role rather than hierarchy, emphasizing accountability, review, and separation of concerns over titles or branding.

**Aside column:**
Structured responsibility overview:
- Project stewardship & architecture — named responsible individual
- Research & academic liaison — named institutional contact
- Clinical and lived-experience advisors — advisory group (collective)
- Engineering contributors — role-based contributors (non-exhaustive)

---

## 6. How ability-adaptive communication works
**Component:** `_six_block_grid`

**Purpose:**
Explain the adaptive loop at a conceptual level without technical detail or performance claims.

**Six blocks (flow):**
1. Capture — movement, sound, context
2. Interpret — probabilistic hypotheses of meaning
3. Confirm — caregiver or communication partner feedback
4. Learn — adaptation over time
5. Record — schemas, logs, auditability
6. Express — speech, text, symbols

---

## 7. Where this began (Origins)
**Component:** `_two_column_with_callout` (new)

**Purpose:**
Provide contextual origin without letting personal narrative dominate system explanation.

**Main (left):**
- Third-person account of how lived experience informed design constraints
- Connection between experience and architectural requirements

**Callout (right):**
- Edited excerpt from *Letter from Andrea*
- First-person voice, boxed and visually distinct
- Optional attribution and photo caption

---

## 8. Values & design principles
**Component:** `_values_list`

**Purpose:**
Make ethical, scientific, and operational constraints explicit and inspectable.

**Values:**
1. Person first
2. Caregiver-in-the-loop
3. Open and inspectable
4. Privacy and safety by design
5. Scientific and clinical rigour

(Each paired with a brief explanation of why the constraint matters.)

---

## 9. Project status
**Component:** `section-status` (Now / Next)

**Purpose:**
Demonstrate realism, maturity, and trajectory without premature claims.

**Now:**
- Architecture defined
- Canonical schemas in place
- Adaptive memory framework established
- Collaboration network forming

**Next:**
- End-to-end demonstrator
- Pilot studies (2026)
- Documentation and training materials
- Privacy-preserving deployments

---

## 10. Collaboration call
**Component:** `_cta_band`

**Purpose:**
Convert informed interest into appropriate next actions.

**Primary CTA:** Contact GestureLabs
**Secondary CTA:** Read technical documentation

---

## Notes
- Single page, layered and scannable
- Andrea’s letter is contextual, not explanatory
- No repeated problem statements
- Architecture / variant / stewardship / responsibility distinctions are explicit
- Avoids product framing and personality-driven narrative
