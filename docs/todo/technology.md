# technology.html – Page Plan

1. Hero Intro
   - Eyebrow: “Technology”
   - Headline: “How A3CP turns multimodal signals into adaptive communication.”
   - Short paragraph explaining A3CP at a high level.

2. End-to-End Pipeline Illustration
   - Full-width banner image: Input Gestures & Sounds → Feature Extraction → Classification → CARE Engine → Output → Feedback loop.
   - One-line caption under figure.

3. Modular Architecture (Six-Block Grid)
   - Section title: “Modular Architecture”
   - Short intro paragraph on modular framework and shared data standards.
   - Six blocks for: Capture Layer, Feature Extraction, Classification, CARE Engine, Memory & Learning, Interface Layer.

4. CARE Engine Focus Section
   - Two-column layout.
   - Left: text (“The CARE Engine”) describing fusion, uncertainty, and clarification.
   - Right: Clarification Loop graphic (System Suggests → Human Feedback → CARE Engine Update).
   - Optional bullet list under the image: what the CARE Engine does.

5. Ethical and Edge-Capable Design
   - Two-column layout.
   - Left: text on privacy, offline/edge capability, open source, derived features only.
   - Right: Cloud/Edge Deployment banner (A3CP Core in center, Edge Run and Cloud Run with “sync when available”).
   - Bullet list of “Design guarantees” under or beside graphic.

6. Development Path
   - Section title: “Development Path”
   - Short intro sentence.
   - Three step cards:
     - Phase 1 – Streamlit demonstrator: gesture capture, landmarks, personalized training.
     - Phase 2 – Modular FastAPI architecture: scalable foundation.
     - Phase 3 (2026) – Integrated gesture + sound classifiers, caregiver-in-the-loop training, early pilots.
   - “Learn more” link/button for each phase (anchor or separate page).

7. Future Possibilities
   - Section title: “Future Possibilities”
   - Short paragraph on adaptive architecture enabling creative, therapeutic, and research uses.
   - Bullet list of potential directions:
     - Gesture-based music/art.
     - Digital avatars and embodied interfaces.
     - Adaptive learning tools for therapy/education.
     - Longitudinal analytics for clinical teams.
     - Multimodal datasets for communication research.
