# SCHEMA_CHANGELOG.md

This changelog tracks all schema-related changes in the A3CP system, including structural updates to `schemas/*.py`, generated `interfaces/*.schema.json`, and example payload formats.

All entries follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and must align with the `schema_version` field embedded in runtime messages.
