- [ ] Guardrail: no payload fields (bytes/base64/data-uri) in schemas, except explicitly designated transport schemas
      - Deferred until schema consolidation pass after camera_feed_worker.
      - Current intentional carriers: LandmarkExtractorInput.frame_data, SoundClassifierInput (audio_format base64/bytes/ndarray), related examples.
      - Decide policy: (A) ref/handle-based payload transport, or (B) stable allowlist of carrier schemas + guard test.
